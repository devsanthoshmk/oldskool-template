# Those function(sort,filter....) format(Deprecated):

```javascript
function sort_by_price(reverse=false){
  if (!reverse){
  //{
  //low to high logic 
  //}
  } else {
  //high to low
  }

  // now change products array within that sorting logic and that's it!!!

  //calling the load funtion to renderProducts with load more button in mind here you dont need to do anythin

  load();

}
```
